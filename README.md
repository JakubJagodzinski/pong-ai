# Fuzzy Logic Pong Controller

This project is a university assignment for the Introduction to AI course, implementing a fuzzy logic controller for a Pong game using the scikit-fuzzy library.
<br>
The controller utilizes fuzzy inference, specifically the Mamdani and Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) models, to autonomously move the paddle based on the ball's position, ensuring effective interception and adaptive gameplay.
